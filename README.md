# Project Description

In this project, a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application was created. This full-stack site will take in results from a survey users take, and then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

# How It Works

‚óè The user will be brought to the home page where they will have the option of either clicking on the <b>"Go to Survey"</b> button, or on the navbar to access the survey that they will be participating in. <br>
